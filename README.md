This project focus is on predicting whether an employee is likely leave or stay (Attrition). Logistic regressin, random forest and Neural network are used for predicting. The Logistic regression showed the best performance on the confusion matrix with an accuracy of over 89%. This project is to demonstrate my ability to use the confusion matrix and understanding of the tensorflow package.

The graphs code can be viewed in Data_prep folder in the pre_process.py module
